# Real-time volume rendering of 3D data using semi-automatic transfer function

Led a project focused on 3D volumetric data visualization using Python, PyQt5, and VTK libraries in a GPUsupported Visual Studio Code environment. The team, consisting of two members, implemented composite raycasting techniques on a fullhead dataset, comprising raw image data and a metaImage file. The application, structured with PyQt5, featured a user-friendly interface for loading and exploring 3D data files, along with comprehensive controls for transfer functions, color adjustments, opacity settings, and gradient configurations. The results showcased visually coherent representations of the dataset, demonstrating the successful integration of interactive elements such as custom input popups, color sliders, opacity controls, and gradient input sliders.
The project highlighted the teamâ€™s expertise in Python, PyQt5, and VTK and their ability to develop impactful visualization tools for complex 3D structures.
